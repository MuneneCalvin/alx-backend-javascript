# ES6 Classes

This project contains tasks for learning to use classes in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **You used to attend a place like this at some point**<br/>[0-classroom.js](0-classroom.js) contains a script that exports a class named `ClassRoom` with the following requirements:
  + Prototype: `export default class ClassRoom`.
  + It should accept one attribute named `maxStudentsSize` (Number) and assigned to `_maxStudentsSize`.

+ [x] 1. **Let's make some classrooms**<br/>[1-make_classrooms.js](1-make_classrooms.js) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import the `ClassRoom` class from [0-classroom.js](0-classroom.js).
  + Export a function named `initializeRooms`. It should return an array of 3 `ClassRoom` objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).

+ [x] 2. **A Course, Getters, and Setters**<br/>[2-hbtn_course.js](2-hbtn_course.js) contains a script that exports a class named `HolbertonCourse` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `name` (String).
    + `length` (Number).
    + `students` (array of Strings).
  + Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation.
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.

+ [x] 3. **Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY**<br/>[3-currency.js](3-currency.js) contains a script that exports a class named `Currency` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `code` (String).
    + `name` (String).
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
  + Implement a method named `displayFullCurrency` that will return the attributes in the format `name (code)`.

+ [x] 4. **Pricing**<br/>[4-pricing.js](4-pricing.js) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import the class `Currency` from [3-currency.js](3-currency.js).
  + Export a class named `Pricing` that meets the following requirements:
    + Constructor arguments:
      + `amount` (Number).
      + `currency` (Currency).
    + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
    + Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
    + Implement a method named `displayFullPrice` that returns the attributes in the format `amount currency_name (currency_code)`.
    + Implement a static method named `convertPrice`. It should accept two arguments: `amount` (Number), `conversionRate` (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.

+ [x] 5. **A Building**<br/>[5-building.js](5-building.js) contains a script that exports a class named `Building` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `sqft` (Number).
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + Implement a getter for each attribute.
  + Consider this class as an abstract class. And make sure that any class that extends from it should implement a method named `evacuationWarningMessage`.
    + If a class that extends from it does not have a `evacuationWarningMessage` method, throw an error with the message `Class extending Building must override evacuationWarningMessage`.

+ [x] 6. **Inheritance**<br/>[6-sky_high.js](6-sky_high.js) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import `Building` from [4-building.js](4-building.js).
  + Export a class named `SkyHighBuilding` that extends from `Building` and meets the following requirements:
    + Constructor arguments:
      + `sqft` (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class `Building`).
      + `floors` (Number).
    + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
    + Implement a getter for each attribute.
    + Override the method named `evacuationWarningMessage` and return the following string `Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors`.

+ [x] 7. **Airport**<br/>[7-airport.js](7-airport.js) contains a script that exports a class named `Airport` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `name` (String).
    + `code` (String).
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + The default string description of the class should return the airport `code` (example below).

+ [x] 8. **Primitive - Holberton Class**<br/>[8-hbtn_class.js](8-hbtn_class.js) contains a script that exports a class named `HolbertonClass` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `size` (Number).
    + `location` (String).
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + When the class is cast into a `Number`, it should return the size.
  + When the class is cast into a `String`, it should return the location.

+ [x] 9. **Hoisting**<br/>[9-hoisting.js](9-hoisting.js) contains a fixed and working copy of the code below:
  ```js
  const class2019 = new HolbertonClass(2019, 'San Francisco');
  const class2020 = new HolbertonClass(2020, 'San Francisco');

  export class HolbertonClass {
    constructor(year, location) {
      this._year = year;
      this._location = location;
    }

    get year() {
      return this._year;
    }

    get location() {
      return this._location;
    }
  }

  const student1 = new StudentHolberton('Guillaume', 'Salva', class2020);
  const student2 = new StudentHolberton('John', 'Doe', class2020);
  const student3 = new StudentHolberton('Albert', 'Clinton', class2019);
  const student4 = new StudentHolberton('Donald', 'Bush', class2019);
  const student5 = new StudentHolberton('Jason', 'Sandler', class2019);

  export class StudentHolberton {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      this._firstName = firstName;
      this._lastName = lastName;
      this._holbertonClass = holbertonClass;
    }

    get fullName() {
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    }

    get holbertonClass() {
      return this.holbertonClass;
    }

    get fullStudentDescription() {
      return `${self._firstName} ${self._lastName} - ${self._holbertonClass.year} - ${self._holbertonClass.location}`;
    }
  }


  export const listOfStudents = [student1, student2, student3, student4, student5];
  ```

+ [x] 10. **Vroom**<br/>[10-car.js](10-car.js) contains a script that exports a class named `Car` with the following requirements:
  + Constructor arguments:
    + `brand` (String).
    + `motor` (String).
    + `color` (String).
  + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
  + Add a method named `cloneCar`. This method should return a new object of the class.

+ [x] 11. **EVCar**<br/>[100-evcar.js](100-evcar.js) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import `Car` from [10-car.js](10-car.js).
  + Export a class named `EVCar` that extends the `Car` class and meets the following requirements:
    + Constructor arguments:
      + `brand` (String).
      + `motor` (String).
      + `color` (String).
      + `range` (String).
    + Each attribute must be stored in an "underscore" attribute version (ex: `name` is stored in `_name`).
    + For privacy reasons, when `cloneCar` is called on an `EVCar` object, the object returned should be an instance of `Car` instead of `EVCar`.
