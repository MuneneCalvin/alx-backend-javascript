## Benchmarks

This library is **10-20 times faster** and more performant than [array-union](https://github.com/sindresorhus/array-union).

See the [benchmarks](./benchmark).

```sh
#1: five-arrays
  array-union x 511,121 ops/sec ±0.80% (96 runs sampled)
  arr-union x 5,716,039 ops/sec ±0.86% (93 runs sampled)

#2: ten-arrays
  array-union x 245,196 ops/sec ±0.69% (94 runs sampled)
  arr-union x 1,850,786 ops/sec ±0.84% (97 runs sampled)

#3: two-arrays
  array-union x 563,869 ops/sec ±0.97% (94 runs sampled)
  arr-union x 9,602,852 ops/sec ±0.87% (92 runs sampled)
```

## Usage

```js
var union = require('arr-union');

union(['a'], ['b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']);
//=> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

Returns only unique elements:

```js
union(['a', 'a'], ['b', 'c']);
//=> ['a', 'b', 'c']
```
