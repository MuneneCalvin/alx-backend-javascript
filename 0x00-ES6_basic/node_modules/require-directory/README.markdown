## How To Use

### Installation (via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/require-directory))

```bash
$ npm install require-directory
```

### Usage

A common pattern in node.js is to include an index file which creates a hash of the files in its current directory. Given a directory structure like so:

* app.js
* routes/
  * index.js
  * home.js
  * auth/
    * login.js
    * logout.js
    * register.js

`routes/index.js` uses `require-directory` to build the hash (rather than doing so manually) like so:

```javascript
var requireDirectory = require('require-directory');
module.exports = requireDirectory(module);
```

`app.js` references `routes/index.js` like any other module, but it now has a hash/tree of the exports from the `./routes/` directory:

```javascript
var routes = require('./routes');

// snip

app.get('/', routes.home);
app.get('/register', routes.auth.register);
app.get('/login', routes.auth.login);
app.get('/logout', routes.auth.logout);
```

The `routes` variable above is the equivalent of this:

```javascript
var routes = {
  home: require('routes/home.js'),
  auth: {
    login: require('routes/auth/login.js'),
    logout: require('routes/auth/logout.js'),
    register: require('routes/auth/register.js')
  }
};
```

*Note that `routes.index` will be `undefined` as you would hope.*

### Specifying Another Directory

You can specify which directory you want to build a tree of (if it isn't the current directory for whatever reason) by passing it as the second parameter. Not specifying the path (`requireDirectory(module)`) is the equivelant of `requireDirectory(module, __dirname)`:

```javascript
var requireDirectory = require('require-directory');
module.exports = requireDirectory(module, './some/subdirectory');
```
